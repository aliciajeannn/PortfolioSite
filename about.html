        Hello! Thank you for taking the time to learn about me. I am a wife and a mom to the world's sweetest boy. 
        We have a dog, a miniature schnauzer named Lincoln. I have been living in Florida since 2011 and recently 
        purchased our first home. Let the DIY projects begin!

        <p>
         I have a deep love for the outdoors and thrive on being in nature. Activities like snorkeling, kayaking, and hiking
         resonate with me, even though I reside in one of the flattest states in the US. My greatest passion lies in traveling. 
         I aspire to find a career that allows me to explore the world while simultaneously indulging in my love for outdoor
          pursuitsâ€”a seamless fusion of my deepest passions.
        </p>

    <div id="employment">
         <p>
            I am currently employed in the banking industry, specializing in catering to an elite clientele. My role encompasses
            providing tailored assistance with their travel arrangements, concierge services, and managing their financial affairs.
            Before joining my current position, I dedicated my time to being a stay-at-home mom. However, even prior to that,
            I held what I consider to be the most incredible job in the world - I served as a flight attendant for the
            rich and famous. I got to travel the world while flying in style. My main source of transportation was a g4. 
            How many people get to say that!
        <p>
            My ambition is to once again lay claim to having the best job in the world. This is precisely what I am working 
            towards by venturing into the realm of full-stack development
