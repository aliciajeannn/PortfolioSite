Here we are showing off our use of the terminal and our ability to make commits to our repo.<br>
We are showing that we are able to create a hmtl page, using correct boiler plates as well as able to add links to other pages.<br>
Also we are showing that we are able to add some flare by using css and also a surprising by adding in a js string.<br>
As of now this is a current rough draft, as we continue to grow our skills, we will be able to add on and edit as our skills grow.<br>
